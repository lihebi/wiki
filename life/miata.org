  - verify that the oil is at the brim of the plug hole
- filler plug tightening torque: 40-53 N.m
- drain plug (24mm) tightening torque: 40-53 N.m

  - install filler plug

- replace every 48 month or 60,000 miles
- use SAE 90, 1 quat

* Brake
** Brake Fluid
Brake fluid will damage paint.

- use DOT-3

Brake should be bled whenever a brake line is disconnected.

- If the disconnection is master cylinder, Start at the brake caliper
  or wheel cylinder farthest from the brake master cylinder, and move
  to the next farthest.
- If not master cylinder, start from the closest to the disconnection
  point.

*** Brake fluid air bleeding
  - jack up vehicle
  - remove bleeder cap, attach a vinyl tube to the bleeder screw
  - place the other end of tube to a brake fluid-filled container
  - the first person depress the brake pedal several times, then hold it in depressed position
  - the second person loosen the bleeder screw, drain out the fluid and closes the screw
  - repeat the first-second person steps until no air bubbles. The
    reservoir should be kept about 3/4 full during the process.
  - tightening torque (8mm): 5.9-8.8 N.m

*** brake fluid replacement
There is no such instruction in the manual. However, searching the internet gives me a rough idea
- suck all the fluid in the reservoir with a turkey baster
- wipe it
- add new fluid
- air bleeding

** Disk
- front disk pad thickness 1.0mm min. look through the caliper
  inspection hole and verify the remaining thickness of the pad.
- front disk plate thickness 18.0mm min
- rear disk pad thickness 1.0mm min
- rear disk plate thickness 8.0mm min
* Clutch
If any clutch pipe has been disconnected, add brake fluid and bleed
the clutch.

- use DOT-3

- bleeder screw tightening torque: 5.9-8.8 N.m
- clutch fluid replacement
  - drain the fluid from the reservoir
  - remove bleeder cap from the clutch release cylinder and attach a
    vinyl hose to the bleeder screw
  - insert the other end of the vinyl hose into a clear container
  - loosen the bleeder screw
  - with another person slowly pumping the clutch pedal, drain the
    fluid from the clutch system, repeat until all fluid is drained
  - tighten the bleeder screw
  - fill the reservoir to MAX
  - bleed the air from the clutch
- clutch fluid air bleeding
  - remove bleeder cap from the clutch release cylinder and attach a
    vinyl hose to the bleeder screw
  - place the other end to a clear container
  - pump clutch pedal several times
  - with the clutch pedal depressed, loosen the bleeder screw, then
    close it.
  - repeat last two steps until clean fluid is seen
  - tighten the bleeder screw.
* Transmission
- check
  - remove check plug at the driver side of the transmission
  - verify that the oil is at the brim of the check plug hole
  - apply sealant and install
- check plug (24mm?) tightening torque: 25-39 N.m
- drain plug (22mm?) tightening torque: 40-58 N.m
- Transmission Oil Replacement
  - remove drain plug and check plug
  - drain the oil
  - install drain plug with new washer
  - add oil to check plug hole to the brim
  - apply sealant to check plug and install
- shift lever turret
  - pump out the old fluid and fill in the new one. use the same oil
    as transmission fluid. Capacity: 80-95cc.
  - apply grease to the shift lever component
  - apply sealant to the contact surfaces of the shift lever component
    and the change control case.

  - https://www.miata.net/garage/trans/everything.html

- replace every 48 month or 60,000 miles
- use SAE 75W-90 GL-4, 2.1 quats

* Power Steering
If any power steering fluid line has been disconnected, add ATF M-III
or equivalent (e.g. Dexron II), bleed the fluid line.

- Air Bleeding
  - inspect fluid level
  - turn the steering wheel fully to the left and right several times
    with the engine not running
  - inspect fluid level. If it has dropped, add fluid
  - repeat steps 2 to 3 until the fluid level stablizes.
  - start the engine and let it idle
  - turn the steering wheel fully to the left and right several times
  - verify that the fluid is not foamy and that the fluid level has
    not dropped.
  - repeat last two steps
- There is no section for flush it. I think
  - from the reservoir, pump out old fluid as much as I can
  - add new ones
  - do air bleeding
