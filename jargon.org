* Marshalling vs Serialization
Both of them convert an object to a data format suitable to read
back. Serialization is a /subset/ of marshalling, i.e. any
serializable object is also marshallable. Marshalling also records the
code base, e.g. when reading back, the class definition of the object
might need to be loaded.

Marshalling seems to be used often in remote servers.
