#+TITLE: Gprof

It is a performance profiling tool for the running time of procedures.

* Steps
** Compile and Run program
Compile with flag =-pg=. It should appear in both compile and link
options, otherwise no call-graph will be produced. Running program as
normal, and =gmon.out= will be produced in the current working directory.

** Running gprof
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
gprof OPTIONS EXECUTABLE-FILE PROFILE-DATA-FILES
#+END_EXAMPLE

- options (pq as default, specify to overwrite)
  - p :: flat profile
  - q :: call graph
  - A :: annotated source code
- EXECUTABLE-FILE :: if not given, use =a.out=
- PROFILE-DATA-FILES :: if not given, use =gmon.out=

Most likely, no options needed. Just run =gprof= in the same directory
with =a.out= and =gmon.out=, it will print to =stdout= the flat
profile and call graph profile.
