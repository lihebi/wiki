VT100 Escape Code

http://www.climagic.org/mirrors/VT100_Escape_Codes.html

All the code starts from =^[=, this is ASCII code for ESC, so they are
called escape code. ESC has decimal value of 27. So in C, sending it is like:

#+BEGIN_SRC c
printf("%c[2K", 27);
printf("\33[2K");
#+END_SRC

=[2k= suffix identify the code "clean the line", so the printf will
clean the line.  It is equivalent to send =\33[2K=. Note that it only
clean the line, in order to overwrite the text you need to make the
cursor to the beginning by =\r=.

Use only =\r= without cleaning the line will have trouble if the
previous line is longer than the new line.

Some code might be interesting:
| Name          | description                  | ESC Code |
|---------------+------------------------------+----------|
| cleareol EL0  | Clear line from cursor right | ^[[K     |
| cleareol EL0  | Clear line from cursor right | ^[[0K    |
| clearbol EL1  | Clear line from cursor left  | ^[[1K    |
| clearline EL2 | Clear entire line            | ^[[2K    |
