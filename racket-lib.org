#+TITLE: Racket Libraries

* Drawing libraries
- metapict: https://github.com/soegaard/metapict
- rosetta: https://github.com/aptmcl/rosetta/tree/master
  - this one is for design 2/3d models, and seems broken and not in
    official support.
- 2htdp/image: in teachpack
- racket/draw: bare-bone, object-oriented, not so interesting
- pict-lib pict: this one is pretty good, functional. It was in
  slideshow

* graph
This is a generic graphic library.  graph is defined through a generic
interface =gen:graph=, supporting the following methods:
- has-vertex?
- has-edge?
- vertex=?
- add-vertex!
- remove-vertex!
- rename-vertex!
- add-edge!
- remove-edge!
- get-vertices
- in-vertices
- get-neighbors
- in-neighbors
- get-edges
- in-edges
- edge-weight
- transpose
- graph-copy
- graph-union!

This actually is mostly not functional.

To construct a graph, use =directed-graph= or =undirected-graph= with
list of edges represented as list of vertex, with first being the
source, rest being target. These functions seems only support single
target.

The library let you define vertex and edge properties, just like those
in boost library. You can do bfs or dfs, shortest path, graph
coloring, maximum flow.

Finally, you can call =graphviz= to convert the graph to a string of
dot format. It cannot output a =pict=.


* 2htdp/image
This is teachpack of How to design program version 2.  It provides
several basic images, rotation, scale, flip, overlay.

Other interesting packages in this pack:
- 2htdp/planetcute contains many images


** Common Concepts
The length is measured in terms of pixels, angle means degree. When
using names, both string and symbol are acceptable, and
case-insensitive.

Mode can be ='solid= or ='outline=. The string format is also
supported. Solid fills, outline only draws the outside line. A integer
between 0 and 255 instead will indicate the transparency.

Color can be name or color structure. If the name is not recognized,
no error is reported, and black is used. The complete list (plus
=transparent=) is in the document of =color-database<%>=. This is an
interface, defined in =racket/draw=.

The color structure is
#+begin_src racket
(struct color (red green blue alpha))
#+end_src


In many places, the color also accepts a pen. =pen= is a structure. It
seems only for drawing lines, so outline mode will support it. Its
definition is

#+begin_src racket
(struct pen (color width style cap join))
#+end_src

- style :: solid, dot, long-dash, short-dash, dot-dash
- cap :: round, projecting, butt
- join :: round, bevel, miter

When doing alignment, you can use pinhole, only if all the images have
a pinhole. You can add pinhole to image by
- center-pinhole image
- put-pinhole x y image
- clear-pinhole

And retrieve pinhole by
- pinhole-x
- pinhole-y


** basic shape
- shape
  - =(circle radius mode color)=
  - =(ellipse width height mode color)=
  - triangle
    - =(triangle side-length mode color)=
    - right-triangle
    - isosceles-triangle
    - triangle/sss
  - square x
  - rectangle x y
  - rhombus x Î¸
  - star
    - star x
    - star-polygon
    - radial-star
  - polygon
    - regular-polygon
    - polygon
    - add-polygon
    - scene+polygon
- line
  - =(line x y color)=: draw a line from (0,0) to (x,y).
  - =(add-line image x1 y1 x2 y2 color)=: add line to image, from
    (x1,y1) to (x2,y2)
  - =add-curve=
  - =add-solid-curve=
- text
  - =(text string font-size color)=
  - =text/font=: this will use a complete font specification,
    including
    - face: which font name
    - family: default, script, modern, etc
    - style: normal, italic
    - weight: normal, bold, light
    - underline?: #t #f


** Overlay
- =overlay= accepts a sequence of images, with the first being on
  top. Images are aligned on their center.
- =overlay/align x-place y-place= controls where to align the images.
  - x: left, right, middle, center, pinhole
  - y: top, bottom, middle, center, baseline, pinhole
- =overlay/offset i1 x y i2=: moves i2 by (x,y) compared to (0,0),
  thus to down right
- =overlay/align/offset= combines both options
- =overlay/xy=: what's the difference from offset?
- =overlay/pinhole=

There's also an =underlay= version that does the reverse order, for
all above.

- =beside= accepts images, and placing them in horizontal row, aligned
  on their centers
- =beside/align y=
- =above=: in a vertical row
- =above/align x=


** scene
Typically you place images on a scene. If an image is placed (using
those place functions) or add lines (using scene+XXX) on scene, it is
cropped based on the size of scene. You can still compose the image by
overlay or add-line, but those does not respect the size of scene.

- =empty-scene x y color=
- =place-image image x y scene=: the (x,y) is according to the
  top-left corner of scene
- =place-image/align image=
- =place-images=: just a list of images and a list of positions
- =place-images/align=
- =scene+line=: add a line to the scene
- =scene+curve=

** transform
- =rotate angle image=
- =scale factor image=
- =scale/xy=: using different factor for x and y
- =flip-horizontal image=
- =flip-vertical image=
- =crop x y width height image=
- =crop/align=
- =frame image=: return an image with a black frame around the
  /bounding box/ of the it. Even if the image might be a circle, the
  bounding box is still rectangle.
- =color-frame color image=


** bitmap
You can load a bit map file by =(bitmap filename)=, or =(bitmap/url
url)= to download from web. For a vector image you created in racket,
you can "freeze" it to bitmap by =freeze image=.

Finally, you can save image to file by
- =save-image image filename [width height]=: png
- =save-svg-image image filename [width height]=: svg

** properties
- image-width
- image-height
- image-baseline


* Networking
** HTML parsing
The package is =html-parsing=. It has only one function, =html->xexp=.

The xexp is a list like this:

#+begin_example
(*TOP* (html (head (title) (title "whatever"))
  (body "\n"
    (a (@ (href "url")) "link"))))
#+end_example

The xexp needs to use =sxml= (needs install) package to
parse. =sxpath= is a function for XPath like query. Use like this
#+begin_src racket
((sxpath '(html body table tr td a @ (*or* href title)))
 table)
#+end_src

sxpath itself returns a function, apply that function on an xexp data,
a list will be returned for matched results.
1. the xexp must begin with =*TOP*=, the query result will not have
   it. So if you want to parse it again, construct it by =`(*TOP* ,x)=
2. the xpath starts from root (html)
3. you can use ='(// table)= to query tables at arbitrary level

** URL & HTTP
require the package =net/url= (needs install) and
=net/url-string=. First, construct a url by =string->url=, then, open
input port by =get-pure-port=, this is using =GET= method. The port
can be used as input, e.g. =port->string=. How to download binary
file, like pdf? It should be bytes streaming, so maybe
- copy-port in out
- port->bytes then write-bytes


The =call/input-url URL connect handle= will call handle on the port,
and close the port on return. The connect is a procedure,
e.g. =get-pure-port=.
