They have plugins, for example the google translate plugin.
But it is awkward to use: =tr en zh hello=

* AutoHotKeys

Right click and create new "AutoHotKey script".

Edit that script:

Rotate.ahk:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
#NoEnv  ; Recommended for performance and compatibility with future AutoHotkey releases.
; #Warn  ; Enable warnings to assist with detecting common errors.
SendMode Input  ; Recommended for new scripts due to its superior speed and reliability.
SetWorkingDir %A_ScriptDir%  ; Ensures a consistent starting directory.

; #n::Run Notepad

; normal rotation
#n::Run D:\tools\display.exe /rotate:0
; portrait rotation
#m::Run D:\tools\display.exe /rotate:90
#+END_EXAMPLE

[[http://noeld.com/programs.asp#Display][=display.exe=]] is a command line tool to change orientation.

Double click to enable it. Change the content and run it again to replace old configure.

* Wake Timer

My computer wake up 10 secs after I asked it to sleep, and I want to know why.
Use this command:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
powercfg -lastwake
#+END_EXAMPLE

The output shows the type of wakeup is /Wake Timer/ and source is =VBoxSVC.exe=.

Solution:
power setting -> advanced setting -> more advanced setting -> sleep -> allow wake timers -> disable
