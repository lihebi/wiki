#+TITLE: Racket

* Trouble shooting

** racket cannot find browsers
Browsers are declared in sendurl.rkt, with

#+BEGIN_SRC racket
  (define all-unix-browsers
    '(
      firefox
      google-chrome
      galeon
      opera
      mozilla
      konqueror
      ;; ...
      ))
#+END_SRC

chromium is not in the list, thus
#+BEGIN_SRC racket
(require net/sendurl)
unix-browser-list ;; empty
(send-url "google.com") ;; error
#+END_SRC

The trick is to create a soft link for chromium named "google-chrome".
Also, the default is using firefox ... So I need to make sure firefox
is uninstalled. Is there a better way to configure browser??

The =racket-doc= will use the local racket document to search, thus in
order for it to work, install =racket-doc= package.
