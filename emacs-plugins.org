#+TITLE: Emacs Plugins

https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/KeyChord

* Flycheck
  The default (at least the one I'm using) for C/C++ is =c/c++-clang=.

  - =flycheck-describe-checker=
  - =flycheck-list-errors=

* AUCTex
  - =C-c C-c=: tex-compile

* DocView
  Can view pdf in emacs. It is convenient to use the same keybinding for =tex-compile=:
  when you press =C-c C-c= the second time after compilation, it will default to =\doc-view=.

** navigation
   - =C-p= =C-n= =C-b= =C-f= still works
   - =+= and =-= to adjust scale
   - =n= and =p= for page navigation
   - =space= and =delete= to page up and down across pages
   - =M-<= and =M->= still works
   - =M-g M-g= works as jump to page

* pdf-tools
  The doc view produce very blur text. The pdf-view-mode provided by pdf-tools solved this.
  Also, this package is said to open pdf on demand. It seems to solve my concern for pdf greatly.

  Extra bonus:
  - search in text
  - view and edit annotations!
