#+TITLE: Emacs Plugins

* Flycheck
The default (at least the one I'm using) for C/C++ is =c/c++-clang=.

- =flycheck-describe-checker=
- =flycheck-list-errors=


* AUCTex
- =C-c C-c=: tex-compile

* DocView
Can view pdf in emacs. It is convenient to use the same keybinding for =tex-compile=:
when you press =C-c C-c= the second time after compilation, it will default to =\doc-view=.

** navigation
- =C-p= =C-n= =C-b= =C-f= still works
- =+= and =-= to adjust scale
- =n= and =p= for page navigation
- =space= and =delete= to page up and down across pages
- =M-<= and =M->= still works
- =M-g M-g= works as jump to page
