Testing systems are typically evaluated using three metrics cite:2014-ESE-Avgerinos
1. number of real bugs found
2. node coverage (stmt coverage, finite)
3. path coverage (infinite, need approximate)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
When you’re operating on the maker’s schedule, meetings are a disaster.
A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, by breaking it into two pieces each too small to do anything hard in.
Plus you have to remember to go to the meeting. That’s no problem for someone on the manager’s schedule.
There’s always something coming on the next hour; the only question is what.
But when someone on the maker’s schedule has a meeting, they have to think about it.

I find one meeting can sometimes affect a whole day.
A meeting commonly blows at least half a day, by breaking up a morning or afternoon.
But in addition there’s sometimes a cascading effect.
If I know the afternoon is going to be broken up, I’m slightly less likely to start something ambitious in the morning.
I know this may sound oversensitive, but if you’re a maker, think of your own case.
Don’t your spirits rise at the thought of having an entire day free to work, with no appointments at all? Well, that means your spirits are correspondingly depressed when you don’t.
And ambitious projects are by definition close to the limits of your capacity. A small decrease in morale is enough to kill them off.

Working late at night might sound like a good idea because there are no (or at least less) interruptions but even programmers need to sleep if they want to avoid burnout.

From https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/4zp5dt/the_true_cost_of_interruptions_game_developer/:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Developers don't try to do hard things when an interruption is impending.

Honestly it's one reason I like instant messaging, whether individual or in a group conversation (IRC, Slack, etc.).
I can see a notification out of the corner of my eye, but it doesn't have the same urgency to respond as, say, a phone call.
At a minimum it lets me complete the thought (e.g. finish writing a paragraph) before I look at the message.

It's also a reason to appreciate working remotely. Nobody "just happens to stop by my desk."
