#+TITLE: Functional Programming

* Map Reduce
map and reduce are from functional programming. Map is just map,
reduce has another familiar name called /fold/.

The Map-reduce framework does not just borrow the name. Its
contribution is scalability and fault-tolerance.

The steps:
1. map: produce data by filtering, and emit the data (marshalling)
2. reduce: fold
