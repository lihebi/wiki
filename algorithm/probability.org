#+TITLE: Probability

* Vocabulary
- sample point: each possible outcome of an experiment
- sample space: set of all sample points, $\omega$
- event E: a subset of $\omega$
  - disjoint: E_1 and E_2 are disjoint if $E_1 \cap E_2 = \emptyset$
  - mutually disjoint: a collection of events are mutually disjoint if
    for every $i \ne j$, $E_i \cap E_j = \emptyset$
- probability function: P from $\omega$ to [0,1]
- $\bar{E}$: $\omega - E$
- uniform probability: $P(x) = \frac{1}{|\omega|}$, P(E) = \frac{|E|}{|\omega|}
- P(E) = \sum_{x\in E}P(x)

- independent: if events A and B are

* Bounds
** Union Bound
$P(\cup_i E_i) \le \sum\limits_i P(E_i)$

This is because of disjoint.
